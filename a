0:
Completely unrelated.
The generated analysis and ground truth discuss entirely different topics, and there is no overlap in content, subject matter, or key elements.
Examples: Ground truth discusses elephants in a zoo, while the generated caption talks about a car in a city.
1:
Minimally related.
The generated analysis and ground truth are tangentially connected, sharing only a small fraction of the topic or content.
The generated analysis may address a vaguely similar setting but fails to align in key aspects (e.g., subject focus, objects, or context).
Examples: Ground truth discusses elephants near a fence, while the generated caption mentions animals without specifying elephants or the fence.
2:
Somewhat related but with notable discrepancies.
The generated analysis and ground truth share key elements in topic or content but exhibit clear differences in focus, description, or details.
While the overall themes or settings may overlap (e.g., animals, fences, grassy area), the generated analysis introduces significant factual errors or omits important details.
Examples: Ground truth describes elephants near a metal fence, while the generated caption describes a zebra near a wooden fence. The settings and context are related but misaligned.
3:
Closely related with small differences.
The generated analysis and ground truth align on the main topic and share most of the key details. However, there are minor differences in phrasing, specific details, or focus.
Examples: Ground truth describes two elephants near a metal fence in front of a grassy area, while the generated caption mentions two elephants near a fence but omits the detail about the grassy area.
4:
Nearly identical.
The generated analysis and ground truth are highly similar, sharing nearly all content, details, and key descriptions, with only minor or negligible phrasing differences.
Examples: Ground truth describes two elephants near a metal fence in front of a grassy area, and the generated caption uses almost the same wording or meaning, with no significant deviations.
